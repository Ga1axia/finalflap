# Flappy Bird Mobile Controller - Hosting Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved
You wanted to host the mobile controller on a separate hosting site while keeping it connected to your Flappy Bird game. This solution provides multiple deployment options with cross-origin support.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Mobile Controller (Hosted)  ←→  WebSocket Server  ←→  Game (Anywhere)
   (GitHub Pages, etc.)         (VPS/Cloud)           (Local/Remote)
```

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Files
- `mobile-controller-standalone.html` - **Host this file** on your chosen platform
- `websocket-server.js` - Enhanced with CORS and production features
- `config.js` - Centralized configuration for easy deployment

### Deployment Files
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
- `deploy.js` - Automated deployment script
- `package.json` - Updated with deployment scripts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Easiest)

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**
2. **Upload `mobile-controller-standalone.html`** and rename it to `index.html`
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Deploy your WebSocket server** to Railway, Heroku, or VPS
5. **Update the mobile controller** with your WebSocket server URL

### Option 2: Automated Deployment

```bash
# Configure your server URLs in config.js first
npm run deploy:github    # For GitHub Pages
npm run deploy:railway   # For Railway
npm run deploy:heroku    # For Heroku
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.js` to set your server URLs:

```javascript
servers: {
    local: 'ws://localhost:8080',
    production: 'wss://your-server.com',
    railway: 'wss://your-app.railway.app',
    heroku: 'wss://your-app.herokuapp.com'
}
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Component | Platform | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Mobile Controller | GitHub Pages | Free |
| WebSocket Server | Railway | $5/month |
| **Total** | | **$5/month** |

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Deploy WebSocket Server
```bash
# Choose one:
npm run deploy:railway
npm run deploy:heroku
# Or deploy to VPS manually
```

### 2. Deploy Mobile Controller
```bash
# Upload mobile-controller-standalone.html to:
# - GitHub Pages (rename to index.html)
# - Netlify
# - Vercel
# - Any static hosting
```

### 3. Update Configuration
- Edit `config.js` with your server URLs
- Update mobile controller with your WebSocket server URL
- Test the connection

## 🔍 Testing

1. **Open your game** in one browser
2. **Open mobile controller** in another browser/device
3. **Enter WebSocket server URL** in mobile controller
4. **Click Connect** and test tapping "FLAP!"

## 📊 Monitoring

The WebSocket server includes:
- **Connection tracking**: See who's connected
- **Health check**: `/health` endpoint
- **Logging**: Detailed connection logs
- **Metrics**: Connection counts and uptime

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CORS errors**: Server has CORS enabled ✅
2. **Connection failed**: Check server URL and firewall
3. **Mobile not responding**: Verify WebSocket connection
4. **Game not receiving**: Check if game is connected to same server

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs for connection attempts
3. Test WebSocket connection manually
4. Verify server is accessible from mobile device

## 🎉 Result

You now have a complete mobile controller system that can be hosted separately from your game while maintaining real-time communication through WebSockets. The mobile controller can be accessed from anywhere on the internet and will control your Flappy Bird game in real-time!
